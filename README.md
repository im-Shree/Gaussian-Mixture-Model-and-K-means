# Performance comparison of Gaussian Mixture Model with K-means 
We will Generate a dataset that consists of 3 clusters. 
Then we will plot the convergence and compare how effectively the data is modeled by a mixture of 3 Gaussians with specific covariance matrices and K-means.

Draw a data set where a mixture of 3 Diagnoal Gaussians, unrestricted covariance matrice and K-means will be plotted and compare who can model the data well. (the covariance matrix is the identity matrix times some positive scalar)

# Conclusion
  #### Spherical Gaussians can model the data well compared to K-means.
  #### Diagonal Gaussians can model the data well compared to K-means and a mixture of spherical Gaussians.
  #### Gaussians with unrestricted covariance matrices can model the data well compared to K-means and a mixture of diagonal Gaussians.
